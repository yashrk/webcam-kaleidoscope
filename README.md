# webcam-kaleidoscope
## What is it?
Is it a party activity, a moving wallpaper or a simple screensaver... We're not sure.
### What's going on?
A web camera is observing something. 
It could be a table with small objects, your face or fingers, or anything else you want to show.
The application transforms this image in real-time like a true kaleidoscope and displays the results on the screen. 
Depending on the shaders used, it can rotate it quickly or slowly, change colors or make it shake.
Keyboard controls are used to manage the shaders.
One can use a standard keyboard and mouse or some mini-keyboard or numpad. 
We used this one: https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005006109748866.html
For others, it may be necessary to develop their own control module (see `src/controls`).
## What do you need?
You will need a system with v4l, a web camera, and a screen.
## How to configure?
In the `config` folder, create a `local.json` file. Then, you can modify the parameters in this file to change settings.
For example, if you want to run the application in fullscreen mode and use our mini keyboard, add the following code to the file:
```
{"fullscreen": true, "keyboard": "mini"}
```
## How to run?
```bash
cargo run
```

## Local configuration
To redefine config params put `local.json` file to `config` folder.
